# canvas_componento

Purpose
- House Poe Canvas apps as canonical sources.
- Extract features, components, and code snippets into `components/` with brief explanations of what they are and what they do.

Critical rule
- Do not edit the app HTML files. Treat them as source-of-truth artifacts only. Keeping HTML untouched avoids needless merge conflicts. All refactoring and explanations belong in `components/` and related docs.

Notes
- This repository focuses on organization and component extraction. Implementation “how-tos” may vary by contributor and are intentionally not prescribed here.

## Updates

- 15-09-2025 - Added Canvas HTML files
