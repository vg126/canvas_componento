# Canvas Perfecto Components

Extracted components from `VG-Canvas-Perfecto.html`. Each markdown file highlights a functional slice of the Canvas Perfection Repository and preserves the canonical snippet straight from the source HTML.

## Available Components

- `architecture_briefing_panels.md` – Static walkthrough of the dual-world model, critical operations, and developer principles.
- `universal_theming_system.md` – Base tokens, mode-specific overrides, and dark-mode preference detection.
- `theme_modal_and_controls.md` – Floating palette launcher plus the modal actions that swap themes.
- `tab_navigation_shell.md` – Sticky navigation bar and switching logic that reveals each tab’s content.
- `feature_testing_lab.md` – Dynamic feature category grid, quick test runner, and initialization hook.
- `field_agent_analysis_module.md` – Inside-the-app request form streaming `@App-Creator` reports.
- `system_updates_monitor.md` – Update search trigger and supporting “app washing” guidance.
- `knowledge_export_and_history.md` – Analysis history renderer and JSON export of accumulated findings.
- `poe_integration_and_markdown_rendering.md` – Handler registrations that parse streamed results with `marked`.

The original HTML file remains untouched and serves as the canonical reference.
