# GMP-this Components

Extracted components from `GMP-this.html`. Each markdown file outlines a functional slice of the Genesis Mapping Protocol Analyzer and includes the relevant code snippet straight from the original HTML source.

## Available Components

- `dark_mode_and_state_setup.md` – Handles theme initialization and caches shared application state and DOM references.
- `input_and_file_handling.md` – Validates concept/file input and enables analysis once prerequisites are met.
- `analysis_workflow.md` – Coordinates recommendations, analysis prompts, and Poe handler responses.
- `stage_display_system.md` – Parses stage-oriented markdown and renders it progressively or all at once.
- `chat_follow_up_interface.md` – Streams follow-up conversations related to the generated analysis.
- `ui_utilities_and_reset.md` – Shared helpers for markdown formatting, loading states, error display, and resetting the UI.

The original HTML file remains unchanged and serves as the canonical reference.
